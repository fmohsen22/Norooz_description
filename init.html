      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Founded in 2012 by Dr. Gharadjedaghi, the Norooz Clinic Foundation (Norooz Clinic) is a community mental health center in the heart of Santa Ana. Our culturally diverse team of mental health professionals is dedicated to providing compassionate care to help youth navigate life's challenges and achieve greater emotional well-being. We prioritize cultural competency and strive to create a safe and inclusive space where everyone feels welcomed, understood, respected, and empowered on their journey toward healing.</p>

      <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
      <p>Norooz Clinic serves Santa Ana youth, their families, and residents ages 5 and up, across all genders and the LGBTQ community. Over 60% of our clients belong to underserved, vulnerable minority populations (Asians, Hispanics, and Blacks) who often lack access to insurance.</p>

        <h3>Youth Expression ProjeKt (YEP)</h3>
        <p>The Youth Expression ProjeKt (YEP) is an educational and mentorship program that equips youth with essential mental health tools and strategies to prepare them for adulthood.

      <h2>Your Help</h2>
      <p>Although we have recently received Medi-Cal provider status, this grant will cover expenses that Norooz Clinic Foundation (NCF) will incur with the launch of YEP at Santa Ana USD (no-cost special services partnership agreement). Some of the costs include mental health counseling services for youth and their families, as well as personnel costs and training for YEP staff on cultural bias and early signs of mental health issues. The grant will also help Norooz Clinic expand its reach and increase the number of Santa Ana youth and families served. With the launch of YEP with SAUSD, YEP is able to provide culturally relevant and responsive services that reduce stigma, embrace mental wellness, and increase community connection. By offering easy access to a basic human need—mental health services—our youth are able to reach their fullest potential in school and have a better chance at a productive, happy life.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Norooz is a Farsi word meaning a new day and a new beginning. Our youth and their families learn the skills and tools to successfully navigate daily problems and stressors, enabling them to experience a new beginning—allowing each day to be a new one. By funding Youth Expression ProjeKt, the City of Santa Ana will be investing in a program that creates opportunities for permanent improvements in our youth's mental health and well-being. We appreciate your support of youth and families in Santa Ana.</p>
